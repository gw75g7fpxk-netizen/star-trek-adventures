Star Trek: Aurora

1. Shards of First Contact The USS Aurora is sent to investigate rumors of sightings of a new Crystalline Entity. There have been no sightings since the Enterprise-D’s last encounter. Instead of the entity, the Aurora finds a fleet of crystal like vessels that immediately attack it. Comms are jammed. Battle through escalating waves of shard fighters and cruisers in a desperate first contact gone hostile. Defeat the shard vanguard boss to take refuge in the nearby asteroid field.

2.  Echoes of the Entity Still unable to hail starfleet, the USS Aurora hides from the Crystalis fleet in an asteroid field. But it too is swarming with shard drones. Navigate the asteroid field, defend against the Crystalis ships, and rescue Federation escape pods of the science vessel that sent the original reports of the crystalline entity. Culminate in a mid-boss skirmish against a pulsing crystal node that is the source of the jammed communications.

3.  Siege of New Horizon From the escape pods survivors, you piece together that they had found the Crystalline Entity - but the Crystalis use pieces it sheds to build their civilization and ships. You are finally able to reach Starfleet and they inform you the Federation colony near your position on New Horizon had just sent out a distress call. Assist New Horizon by providing orbital defense, destroying waves of attackers to protect ground defenses and evacuate civilian pods. Hold them off until reinforcements arrive. (Reinforcements arrive at the same time as the last wave, and help drive them back).

4. Fractured Nexus The reinforcements lead by the Galaxy Class ship USS Sentinel persue the fleeing remains of the Crystalis fleet. The Aurora is left behind as it handles repairs. Not long after the fleet leaves the Aurora receives a distress call from a Federation resupply convoy. Fight your way through stationary weapon platforms and mine fields attracted to your engines you need to destroy before they hit you. End with a boss that fractures into multiple agile targets upon damage. Defeating it saves the convoy.

5.  Guardian Protocol Intercept a distress call from the damaged Galaxy-class USS Sentinel, crippled by a crystal ambush. Escort and shield the Sentinel through a gauntlet of pursuing shard swarms, buying time for emergency repairs. Survive a multi-phase boss where the crystals target the Sentinel’s vulnerable warp core. 

6.  Romulan Shadows Romulan forces intervene, looking to take advantage of the Crystalis to weaken the Federation’s presence near their border. Fight opportunistic Romulan fighters alongside crystals in chaotic crossfire, then confront their treachery in a massive Warbird boss battle with cloaking phases and disruptor barrages. 

7.  Resonant Swarm Crystals begin harmonizing into larger formations, drawn by your prior engagements. Battle synchronized waves that adapt to your firing patterns, rescuing a convoy of Federation supply pods amid the chaos. Shatter a resonant hive boss that spawns reinforcements from its facets. 

8.  Federation Counterstrike Starfleet reinforcements arrive; coordinate with allied fighters and fight along side the USS Sentinel to assault a crystal staging ground. Protect wingmen while pushing through dense enemy lines and pod clusters for massive multipliers. Climax against a battleship enforcer with shield generator sub-targets. 

9.  Harbinger’s Wake Trace the crystals back to their home planet: an awakening proto-entity emitting destructive pulses. Survive reality-warping waves that phase enemies in and out, rescuing the last escape pods from a doomed outpost. Defeat harbinger guardians foreshadowing the final threat. 

10.  Crystalline Reckoning Confront the flag ship of the Crystalis fleet in an epic finale. Endure multi-phase onslaughts—shields, turrets, core vulnerabilities—while dynamic waves intensify. Destroy the entity core to shatter the enemy and claim victory.
